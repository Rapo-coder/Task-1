                    Imagine an international gateway 
                    where goods and merchandise flow 
                    across borders. Where countries 
                    lower taxes, reduce red tape, and 
                    eliminate road blocks. Where 
                    companies import goods and 
                    merchandise directly into a Free 
                    Trade Zone - and then ship products 
                    out duty free.

                    The Miami Free Trade Zone connects 
                    North America, Europe and Asia to 
                    Latin America and the Caribbean via 
                    direct air and sea transportation 
                    links, plus rail and expressway. 
                    Operated by FTZ World Services, the 
                    47-acre Zone (#372) saves 
                    companies money and time.
