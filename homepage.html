                    Imagine an international gateway where
                    goods and marchandise flow across
                    borders. Where countries lower taxes,
                    reduce red tape, and eliminate road
                    blocks. Where companies import goods and
                    merchandise directly into a Free Trade
                    Zone without paying duties, fees, and taxes
                    -and then export products duty and
                    tax free.
